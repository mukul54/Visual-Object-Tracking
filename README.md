# Visual-Object-Tracking
Some of the work done during the winter research intern at IIST, Trivandrum. Most of the codes are inspired by official [CODT](https://github.com/xgniu/Context-based-Occlusion-Detection-Tracking)
and and [KCF](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~joao/circulant/index.html) code. PowerPoint presentation of the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1imTnKg0dubc_9v1a56l7XJl7vL8sSM-0/view?usp=sharing)
