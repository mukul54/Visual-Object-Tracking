# Visual-Object-Tracking
Some of the work done during the winter research intern at IIST, Trivandrum. Most of the code in this repository is inspired from the official [CODT](https://github.com/xgniu/Context-based-Occlusion-Detection-Tracking) repository. My code can give precission along with the FPS measure. Video link for the comparison has been included in the video for presentation folder.
To run the tracker run the file run_tracker_seq.m .
